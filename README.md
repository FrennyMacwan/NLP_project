1. goal & topic -
Creating a chatbot using Deep learning algorithm with movie subtitles 

2. dataset from kaggle -  Cornell Movie-Dialog Corpus
This corpus contains a metadata-rich collection of fictional conversations extracted from raw movie scripts:

- 220,579 conversational exchanges between 10,292 pairs of movie characters
		- involves 9,035 characters from 617 movies
		- in total 304,713 utterances
		- movie metadata included:
					- genres
					- release year
					- IMDB rating
					- number of IMDB votes
					- IMDB rating
					- character metadata included:
					- gender (for 3,774 characters)
					- position on movie credits (3,321 characters)

3. task - try to use RNN and check the result

4. expected results - chatbot should be answerable

5. potential relevance for master thesis - Dealing with movie subtitles would be  a challenging task. Data pre-processing is the most important task. For masters thesis it will give some ideas how to treat this kind of data.
